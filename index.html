                <p class="messages">What impact has Steve Jobs had in my life? Every short story ive written as an adult
                    (and certainly evryone that has been published) almost every email i've ever written, has been
                    written on machines created by Apple. I interacte donline using Apple machine long before I
                    encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed about as a kid and
                    through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You will be missed Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all
                    your amazing work.</p>
